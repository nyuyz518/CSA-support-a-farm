This is a early stage project in Flatiron web development camp, I developed a website where shoppers can view and shop produce to support local farms.
Implemented backend REST service using Ruby on Rails, designed relational database schema. 
To run: use `bundle` to update Gemfile dependencies, `rails s` to start, and then go to brower enter http://localhost:3000/
